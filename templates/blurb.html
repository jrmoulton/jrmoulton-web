<p>Hey I'm Jared!</p>
<p>I'm a computer engineering student and I get excited about building things that help people.</p>
<p>Here, I share the cool stuff I'm learning, including future articles and series on compilers, embedded hardware, hardware design, and smart accessories using the matter protocol.</p>
<p>Oh, and rust btw.</p>
