A cpu is a bunch of transistors. 

Transistors are little on/off switches that can be controlled (these are created by combining different kinds of silicon together). Those switches can be combined to create logic gates. 

Logic gates are an arrangement of switches that have inputs and outputs and with the right arrangement of switches the outputs can react to combinations of the inputs.  
For example an arrangement of switches can be made so that the output is only high when all of the inputs are also high. This is called an And Gate (because the first AND the second AND all other inputs must be high). 

Other arrangements of switches can be made to create other gates such as the Or and Not gates. These logic gates can be combined to create digital logic circuits. 

Digital logic circuits are combinations of logic gates that will
