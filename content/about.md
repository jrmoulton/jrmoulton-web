# A new blog
``` date

A few years ago when I was first learning programming I thought often about how useful it would be to write down the information I was learning from the perspective of a newbie because I knew what the actual difficulties were for a beginner. But I was too busy learning programming to actually write about it. So now a few years have gone by, I'm not so much of a begginer anymore and this probably isn't going to be as useful as it once was... but here we are. And I'm doing it. 

## The goal

The goal for this blog is to write about things as I learn them, not create tutorials. I hope to be able to capture the insights that I'll gain when I first start learning a new thing and share them in a way that is both informational and entertaining. In the next year or two I have a large number of goals for things that I would like to learn and accomplish. I want to build a keyboard from scratch. This includes designing with 3d modeling software the housing, designing the PCB (I'll have someone else print it) and writing the firmware from kind of scratch in rust. I want to work on building the blog engine that I'll use to make this blog awesome (or at least as aweosme as a programming blog can be). I want to continue to build random cli tools such as my [tmux sessionizer](https://github.com/jrmoulton/tmux-sessionizer) and develop other rust embedded-hal drivers like my [DACx0501 driver](https://github.com/jrmoulton/dacx0501) and continue to work on [esp-hal](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal). Ideally having this blog will motivate me to work on and finish larger scale projects as I write and incrementally publish what I've worked on.  

## Where this blog currently is

Currently this blog is just me writing markdown files in Neovim. I'm not super satisfied with the current offerings for static site generation such as Hugo and zola and I think I want to build a custom engine similar to what [Amos/fasterthanlime](https://fasterthanli.me) has.
